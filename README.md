# Iron_Coder_Solutions
Home to all of my solutions to the different iron coder challenges.

These challenges can be completed in any langauge, however, my language of preference is usually Python.

#### NOTE:
If you do help with a challenge and it is being done in Python, make sure to write tests and ensure the build passes.


## Update
- The challenges are now located in the [CodeNewbie Discourse](http://discourse.codenewbie.org/)!
